# Smart Fleet Maintenance Assistant

This project is a small AI agent for the transport industry designed to help manage vehicle maintenance in a fleet.

## Features

- **Vehicle Maintenance Checks:** Checks if a vehicle is due for an oil change, tire change, or general service based on mileage and last service date.
- **CLI Interface:** Simple command-line interface to interact with the assistant.
- **Rule-Based Logic:** Uses straightforward rules (e.g., oil change every 5000 miles) to predict when maintenance is due.
- **Extensible:** Designed to be easily expandable to use real-time sensor data, integrate with APIs, or add scheduling.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Clone or unzip the project.
3. Run the assistant:

```bash
python run_agent.py
```

4. Follow prompts to check maintenance status for a vehicle (e.g., `truck_1` or `van_3`).
